ðŸŽµ Format converter, takes a local path to a WAV file and turns it to HLS, HTTP live streaming, one of the most widely used video streaming protocols.
### Why would you want to convert WAV? 
You won't often download WAV files from music sites. The files are much larger than the equivalent in other formats, and they don't give the listener much of an advantage.
But when recording, editing and transferring data between editors they maintain a very high quality.
### Why HLS?
With streaming over HTTP, the standard request-response pattern does not apply. The connection between client and server remains open for the duration of the stream, and the server pushes video data to the client so that the client does not have to request every segment of video data.
